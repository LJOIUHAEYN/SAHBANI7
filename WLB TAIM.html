            <h2>The Rolex Yacht-Master II</h2>
            <p class="card-text">In 2007, 15 years after introducing the Yacht-Master, Rolex took its sailing watch to the next level by adding one of the most complicated movements the brand has ever made. Equipped with a programmable countdown and a mechanical memory, the Yacht-Master II is designed to help yachtsmen time the start of their regattas with Swiss precision, not to mention look great with a double-breasted navy blazer.</p>

            <h2>The Rolex Yacht-Master</h2>
            <p class="card-text">As sports go, yachting is up there with polo and fencing when it comes inaccessibility and general abstruseness—which might explain why the Yacht-Master doesn’t get as much attention as some of its siblings. You don’t, however, need a yacht club membership or a working knowledge of how to raise a spinnaker to appreciate its charms. It's the only “Professional” Rolex model available in three case sizes (37mm, 40mm, and 42mm), and while its bezel, dial, and Cyclops date window give it a similar look to the Submariner, the Yacht-Master scores points for originality as one of two Rolex models available in the brand’s proprietary RLX titanium.</p>

            <h2>The Rolex Cosmograph Daytona</h2>
            <p class="card-text">If you got into watches anytime after 2017, the Rolex Daytona probably had something to do with it. That was the year a Daytona once owned by Paul Newman sold for nearly $18 million—setting the vintage watch market on fire in the process. Designed in the 1960s to time laps at the Daytona International Speedway in Florida (and still given to winners of the Rolex 24 at Daytona race each January), the Daytona has become one of the most collectible watches on the planet. To celebrate the model’s 60th birthday this year, Rolex overhauled the entire Daytona line with a new chronograph movement, adding a sapphire case back to the platinum version, and rolling out a new model in white gold with a vintage-inspired dial.</p>

            <h2>The Rolex Sea-Dweller</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Ever since inventing the waterproof case back in the 1920s, Rolex has been creating watches equipped to push ever-deeper into the abyss. The Sea-Dweller launched in 1967 with an impressive water-resistance rating of 610 m, and has since doubled that to an even more audacious 1220 m. Burlier and heavier than the Submariner, the Sea-Dweller is as much a proof-of-concept as it is a beefy fashion accessory.

            <h2>The Rolex Deepsea</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Rolex took another big plunge in 2008 with the launch of the Deepsea, a.k.a. the watch worn by James Cameron when he ventured seven miles below the ocean’s surface to the Mariana Trench. If you’re headed down that way, or just find the Sea-Dweller’s 1220 m of water-resistance too paltry, this watch’s 3900 m water-resistance rating (and distinctive “D-blue” gradient dial) should do the job nicely.

            <h2>The Rolex Deepsea Challenge</h2>
            <p class="card-text">
                Some watches are made to be worn, and others are made to prove a point. The Rolex Deepsea Challenge, which is rated water-resistant to 11,000 m (which, not incidentally, is deeper than the deepest part of the ocean), is very much the second kind. Despite being made out of ultralight RLX titanium, the Deepsea Challenge’s 50 mm wide and 23 mm thick case pushes the limits of wearability, a small price to pay for ultimate bragging rights.
